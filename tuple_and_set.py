# Tuple 
#   -> same as list 
#   -> can't change the value it's immutable
#   -> using round brack it implements 

#   Eg 
tup = (2,3,4,56,3,34,3,4)
print(tup)

#O/p
#(2, 3, 4, 56, 3, 34, 3, 4)

# Access index value 
print('\nSecond index value ',tup[2])

#o/p
#Second index value  4

#count 
print('Count of tuple =:',tup.count)

#Advanges 
# 1 don't change value append insert method not work here
# 2 Fast excution than list 

# Set 
#   -> set is collection of unique elements
#   ->using curly brackets it implements

s = {22,34,32,45,23}

print('\n Set s =>',s)

#O/p
# Set s => {32, 34, 45, 22, 23}

# set can't give sequence value in python
# using hash increase the performance 
# indexing  are not support
